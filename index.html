    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
      I’m Xavier Brown — a painter, digital media artist, and honors psychology student at Portland State University.
      My work explores the liminal space between internal cognition and external representation — between memory and ritual,
      between neural resonance and aesthetic artifact.
    </p>
    <p>
      Currently, I’m preparing for a study abroad research experience in Bologna, Italy, supported by the Gilman Scholarship.
      My goal is to conduct field interviews and visual studies related to symbolic architecture, active inference, and the sensory vocabulary of Italian design.

    <h2>Portfolio</h2>
    <img src="assets/portfolio/your-painting.jpg" alt="Painting titled: Threshold Memory">
    <p>
      <strong>Threshold Memory</strong> (oil on canvas) explores layered consciousness and the illusion of time during the onset of sensory overwhelm. Created after studying synesthesia in neuropsych literature.
    </p>

    <img src="assets/portfolio/your-video-still.jpg" alt="Still from: Inference Loop">
    <p>
      <strong>Inference Loop</strong> (video, 3m21s) is a procedural video experiment exploring self-updating mental models, accompanied by a Friston-inspired narration of Bayesian priors.

      <h3>On Active Inference and Artistic Process</h3>
      <p>
        What if painting wasn't about expressing an emotion — but about reducing epistemic uncertainty?
        This piece explores how predictive processing theory can reshape how we understand the artist's role
        as a model-building agent in a dynamic world.

      <h3>Symbolic Spaces: Notes from Italy</h3>
      <p>
        A short field note from my upcoming work in Bologna: walking through the Basilica of San Petronio
        and noticing the embodied weight of stained glass as a compression algorithm for collective memory.

    <h2>Research Projects</h2>
    <p>
      I'm currently developing a research portfolio on the intersections of:
      <ul>
        <li>Mind-technology interaction</li>
        <li>Quantum randomness in embodied cognition</li>
        <li>Visual culture and internal representation</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      My senior thesis explores the psychological architecture of symbolic systems, referencing Friston’s active inference and Varela’s enactive cognition,
      with an eye toward artistic practices as ecological feedback loops.
    </p>

  <section id="interviews">
    <h2>Interviews</h2>
    <p>
      While abroad in Bologna, I will be interviewing Italian researchers, artists, and students about how
      tradition, neuroscience, and technology shape the evolving landscape of cognition and cultural identity.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Prof. Alessio Avenanti – Cognitive Neuroscience & Motor Systems</li>
      <li>Prof. Francesca Tomasi – Digital Humanities</li>
      <li>Martina (student, Fine Arts Academy of Bologna)</li>
    </ul>
